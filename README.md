# Stormpath Shiro Web Sample

Fork of the Apache Shiro Web sample application that uses Stormpath for User Management. This sample application uses the [Apache Shiro plugin for Stormpath](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-shiro) to demonstrate how to integrate Apache Shiro and Stormpath.

Stormpath is a User Management API that reduces development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Stormpath's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application. The `stormpath-shiro` plugin allows a [Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org/)-enabled application to use [Stormpath](http://www.stormpath.com) for all authentication and access control needs.

## Documentation

Stormpath offers usage documentation and support for the Apache Shiro Plugin for Stormpath [in the wiki](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-shiro/wiki). Please email support@stormpath.com with any errors or issues with the documentation.
